Inspiration: Technical problem to test my front-end skills using databases. 

What it does: Able to create, assign, and delete users to the bookings table of the entr_testdb. 

1) Fill out information and click 'submit', to be added to the database and 'bookings' table.
2) See existing user entries, as well as the newest created (by you). 
3) Click on an entry to delete its information permanently. 

How I built it: Using a combination of HMTL, CSS, PHP, and SQL.

What I learned: How to use XAMPP to run/host server-side applications.
